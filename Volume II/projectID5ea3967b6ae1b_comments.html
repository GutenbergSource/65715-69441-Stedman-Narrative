<HTML><BODY><h4>About the book</h4>
<p><strong>Full title:</strong> Narrative, of a five years’ expedition, against the revolted Negroes of Surinam, in Guiana, on the wild coast of South America, from the year 1772, to 1777. Volume 2 of 2.</p>
<p><strong>Wikipedia:</strong> This narrative covers his years in Surinam as a soldier in the Dutch military deployed to assist local troops fighting against groups of escaped slaves. He first recorded his experiences in a personal diary that he later rewrote and expanded into the Narrative. The Narrative was a bestseller of the time and, with its firsthand depictions of slavery and other aspects of colonization, became an important tool in the early abolitionist cause. When compared with Stedman’s personal diary, his published Narrative is a sanitized and romanticized version of Stedman’s time in Surinam.  </p>
<p><strong>Pub. Date:</strong> 1796.<br />
<strong>Author:</strong> From wikipedia: John Gabriel Stedman (1744 – 7 March 1797) was a Dutch-born Scottish colonial soldier.  </p>

<h4>Proofing</h4>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard.<br />
<strong>Guidelines:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the sidenotes. (Reminders of the current chapter number are not useful in an ebook.)  </li>
<li>Otherwise there are no exceptions to the Guidelines.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>This is an old text containing long s, catchwords and ligatures. If you are unfamiliar with any of those, read up on them on the <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofing_old_texts">wiki page about proofing old texts</a>.  </li>
<li>Captions of the illustrations and some of the words on the title page are in a font which can be difficult to read.  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Wordcheck</h5>
<p>This is not a special instruction as such but a bit of a departure from the Guidelines for P1.</p>
<p>I’d like the P1 proofers to use the WordCheck facility. This is mandatory for the P2 and P3 proofers so this is a chance for the P1 proofers to get into the habit of hitting ‘WordCheck’ before saving a page.</p>
<p>Here’s a short list of rules showing which words I’d like you add to the Good Words suggestion list by using the green flag in the WordCheck interface.  </p>
<ol>
<li>It is correct to suggest proper names.  </li>
<li>It is correct to suggest words in other languages as long as they match the scan.  </li>
<li>It is not correct to suggest either half of a hyphenated word that has been split between pages.  </li>
<li>It is not correct to suggest a word you’re unsure about - typos, unclear words, or anything that looks “wrong” to you. That’s where you could leave a [** ] note to comment on your concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use of WordCheck is mandatory for P2 and P3. Any pages completed in P2 and P3 without WordCheck will be cleared at the discretion of the Project Manager.</p>
